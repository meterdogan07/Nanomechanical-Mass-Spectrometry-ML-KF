- basic_threshold_method : This includes the threshold based kalman filter. The codes outputs

- optimal_threshold_selection : This file includes search based threshold selection algorithm. Also, the found threshold can be tested.

- plot_threshold_result : we perform a range search to find the distribution of the false detection and miss values for different event sizes and thresholds.

- windowsize_vs_mineventsize : Creates a plot for the theoretical dependancy of window size versus minimum detectable event size.
