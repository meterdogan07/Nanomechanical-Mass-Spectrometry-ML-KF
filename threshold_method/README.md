- basic_threshold_method.m : This script includes the threshold based kalman filter. The code outputs the figure of detected event vs the actual event.

- optimal_threshold_selection.m : This script includes search based threshold selection algorithm. Also, the found threshold can be tested.

- plot_threshold_result.m : This script performs a range search to find the distribution of the false detection and miss values for different event sizes and thresholds.

- windowsize_vs_mineventsize.m : Creates a plot for the theoretical dependency of window size versus minimum detectable event size.
